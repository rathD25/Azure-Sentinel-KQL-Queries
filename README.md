# Sentinel-KQL-Queries
Just some KQL queries I wrote/helped write recently.
Queries are:
- ASR Rules Audit: Query the DeviceEvents table for Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules set to *audit* mode.
- ASR Rules Block: Query the DeviceEvents table for Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules set to *block* mode.
- System Uptime: Query the Perf table for the uptime of servers.
- Login Failures: Query the SigninLogs table for failed logins and summarize results by user and period of time.
